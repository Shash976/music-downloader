# music-downloader
Hope I don't get into legal issues for this. Using python libraries of `music-tag` and `pytube` this code can download entire youtube playlists in both MP3 or MP4  versions. It also automatically adds tags like 'album', 'artist', etc. to the MP3/MP4 file. Great for those who still like to download their song old-style
